MapManager provides both a desktop and a web app.

The first thing you will do is import a file with raw image data. Before you do that, check the [supported-file-formats].


=== "Desktop"

    - Download the app for macOS or Windows
    - Run the app
    - Import your image data (see [supported file formats][supported-file-formats])


=== "Web"

    - Point your browser to xxx
    - Drag and drop an image file (see [supported file formats][supported-file-formats])
